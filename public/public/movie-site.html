    <h3>The Brood</h3>
    <p>David Cronenberg absolutely nails what it's like to get therapy in this thriller. I love that the therapist was the guy who died while filming Gladiator.</p>
    <h3>Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy</h3>
    <p>This movie came at an interesting time in my life and it was wonderful to experience emotions through Bridget's hardships again.</p>
    <h3>Babygirl</h3>
    <p>Nicole Kidman and her plastic surgery turned this movie from a 4 to a 6. I like that they referenced her plastic surgery negatively several times in the film.</p>
    <h3>Y2K</h3>
    <p>This movie sucked and I loved every minute of it.</p>
